# Golden Task Breast_Cancer_Clasification
## Overview
Welcome to the Breast Cancer Classification project! This repository showcases a data science project consists of GUI seperately, that focuses on classifing breast cancers types using machine learning techniques.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a GUI(Graphical User Interface) in which the user can give the input and using machine learning models that can identify different types of breast cancers types based on the data.

## Key Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were instrumental in the development and analysis of the Breast Cancer classification project:

- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn):** Utilized for building machine learning models, including classifiers for identifying the diferent types of the breast cancers based on the data.

- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis, loading and manipulating the data present in the dataset.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Employed for data visualization to gain insights into the distribution of features and visualizing model performance.

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used as the interactive computing environment for developing, experimenting, and documenting the analysis process.

- **Tkinter:** Used to create a responsive Graphical User Interface(GUI).

- **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical operations and computations in data preprocessing and model training.

These libraries, in conjunction with Python, formed the foundation for building, training, and evaluating the breast cancer classification model with Unique Graphical User Interfacce(GUI).


## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required Python libraries and dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.

Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to perform analysis and to see the graphical user interface for breast cancer classification related data.

Visualize the results.
